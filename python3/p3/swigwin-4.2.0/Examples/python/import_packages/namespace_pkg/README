  This is an example (and test) of using swig generated modules in the context
of python3's namespace packages:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/

  Consequently, this example requires python (3.3 or newer) to build and run.

  This example creates a simple swig module named robin.  The robin.py module
has a companion C module named _robin.so.  The robin module is tested in four
ways:

  1) As a non-package module (tested by nonpkg.py)

  2) With robin.py and _robin.so in the brave package under the path1
     subdirectory.  (tested by normal.py)

  3) With robin.py in path2/brave and _robin.so in path3/brave
     (tested by split.py)

  4) With robin.py contained in a zip file (path4.zip) as brave/robin.py and
     _robin.so found on the filesystem under path3/brave (tested by zipsplit.py)

Note: Using namespace packages with subpackages (such as brave.sir.robin) where
      robin.py is located in a zipfile requires python-3.5.1 or newer as
      python's zipimporter only worked with packages of depth 1 until then.
