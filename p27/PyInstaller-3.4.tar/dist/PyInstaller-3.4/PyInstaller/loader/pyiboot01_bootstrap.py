# (with "pythonw"), print randomly fails with "[errno 9] Bad file descriptor"
# when the printed text is flushed (eg: buffer full); this is because the
# sys.stdout object is bound to an invalid file descriptor.
# Python 3000 has a fix for it (http://bugs.python.org/issue1415), but we
# feel that a workaround in PyInstaller is a good thing since most people
# found this problem for the first time with PyInstaller as they don't
# usually run their code with "pythonw" (and it's hard to debug anyway).
