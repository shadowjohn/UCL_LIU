Changelog for PyInstaller 3.0 â€“ 3.2.1
======================================================

3.2.1 (2017-01-15)
------------------

- New, updated and fixed hooks: botocore (#2094), gi (#2347), jira (#2222),
  PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets (#2269), skimage (#2195, 2225), sphinx (#2323,)

  considerably slower in some applications, and still has a couple
  of small issues on PY3. (#1920)

- (OS X) Replace run-time search path keyword (#1965)
